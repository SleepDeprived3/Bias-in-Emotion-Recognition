We had trouble adding project data to our GitHub due to the sheer quantity of the audio files from our datasets. Instead, we have linked out datasets below:

1. Crema-D Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/cremad
2. Toronto emotional speech set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess
3. Speech accent archive dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/speech-accent-archive
